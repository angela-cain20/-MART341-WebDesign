What is the goal of your website? (Think in terms of your user -- why might they visit your site?)
Why is responsive web design important?


The website I will be creating is a artworks portfolio of a 'made up' tattoo/piercing artist to advertise their works / body modification artwork I find interesting. I chose to do a portfolio for a fictional business/artist for two reasons, 1. I personally don't have many outstanding works to put into a portfolio, and 2. I believe researching different artists/studios and formulating a website that is a conglomeration of their works would be a more interesting/fun challenge.
The goal of a portfolio website is to showcase works and accomplishments of a person/company/artist to entice future customers into procuring goods/services and demonstrate a level of education/skill that the artists/studio has. Users may visit the site to conduct research, shop for products, or foster curiosity. 

Responsive web design is important because the website increases its efficiency, accesibility, and traversability.
