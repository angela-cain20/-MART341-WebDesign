              <h2>Highlight of the Week</h2>
                <p style="display:inline-block;">As a queer person of color who practices healing witchcraft, I find great beauty in the fluid and inclusive nature of paganism. It allows for a celebration of diverse identities and experiences, and the art that it inspires reflects this multifaceted beauty. From the intricate designs of mandalas to the colorful depictions of goddesses and faeries, pagan art boasts a richness and diversity that inspires the spirit and the soul. Through my own practice, I have discovered a deep connection to the natural world and an appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things, which has only enhanced my appreciation for the beauty of pagan art.
