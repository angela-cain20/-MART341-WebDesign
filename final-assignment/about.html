				<h2>My Story</h2>

					<p>Born in 2002, I've joined my generation in a post 9/11 slum of psychosocially, economicly, and culturally impacted upbringing. In 2008, I reached sentience at the peak of the recession coming from a lower middle class and witnessed the uproar of racism against President Obama. Like many other members of Generation Z, these climactic events instilled a drive to not only be sucessfull, but also meaningful and influential in my societal and cultural presence.</p>
					
					<p>Like every other 20-something I've felt a sense of confusion and fear surrounding my future and career goals. I have changed majors from Radiologic Technology to Parks/Recreation/Tourism studies, to Computer Science, to Japanese, and finally back to Computer Science! No matter how I viewed my future, I knew that I wanted to create something with purpose, to help others, and to speak for my community. </p>

					<p>As a result, I've decided to spend my time working towards the starkly underdeveloped and undermarketed field of medical device coding and prosthetics design. As a disabled individual myself, I feel that the medical devices and prosthetics on the market are embarassingly underdeveloped and not representative of their target demographics to be so intensly overpriced. I hope to be a stepping stone individual in the process to change this phenomenon. </p>
