I've seen several different forms when browsing the internet. For example, there are forms similar to the one made in the assignment, where businesses allow for comments, polls, and contact forms to promote their business and facilitate communication with their customers. I've also seen more forms that are similar to entertainment forms, like "which harry potter house are you" quizzes. There are also more formal forms like the FAFSA.
