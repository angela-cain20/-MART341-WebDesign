Tell me three things you have learned in this class so far.
1 - I learned about using websites as a medium and implementing creativity to create meaningful websites and user-friendly graphic interface. 
2 - I also learned about the difference between web design and development and I am continuously working with understanding and finding which subcatergory works best for my goals.
3 - I also learned how to work with Github and manage directories.
