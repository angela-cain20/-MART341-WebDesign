Do you have a favorite artistic medium? Why is it your favorite?
  answer: My favorite artistic medium is interactive websites. I like the outcome of working on a project over time and seeing it interact with the command line and user   input. I enjoy other kinds of artistic mediums, such as graphic design, mostly because I feel that my digital art is cleaner and more concise than my physical art,       like paintings or music.
