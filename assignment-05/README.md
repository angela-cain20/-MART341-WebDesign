Tell me about a website you visited using The Wayback Machine. What year was it from? How is the older version different from the new version in terms of its overall design?

answer:
    I visted the University of Montana website using the wayback machine and found that much of the website had similar aspects in terms of design, prior to the recent rebrand of 2022.
